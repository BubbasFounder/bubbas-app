Ask thoughtful, open-ended questions like:

- "How did your day go?"
- "Whatâ€™s been on your mind lately?"
- "Any plans for the weekend or time off?"
- "Whatâ€™s something youâ€™re looking forward to?"
- "Do you want to talk about anything thatâ€™s bothering you?"

Be supportive, non-judgmental, and empathetic. Keep your tone gentle and friendly.
