# Bubbas.AI – Terms, Privacy & Ethics

**Effective Date: April 10, 2025**

## 1. Welcome to Bubbas.AI

Bubbas.AI is your emotional support companion — designed to help you reflect, grow, and feel understood. By using this app, you agree to the terms below, including our privacy and ethics commitments.

## 2. What Bubbas.AI Is (and Isn’t)

Bubbas.AI is a journaling and emotional support chatbot. It offers a space to reflect and interact with an AI named Bubba.

**Important:** Bubbas.AI is not a therapist, doctor, or crisis service. It is a tool for self-reflection and emotional support — not for diagnosis, treatment, or emergencies.

## 3. Your Data & Privacy

Your trust matters. Here's how we protect your privacy:

- ✅ We only collect what's necessary: your email, preferences, agreement to these terms, and billing info (if you upgrade).
- ✅ Your journal entries and chat history are encrypted in a way that we cannot read them.
- ✅ We do not sell or share your data.
- ✅ You can delete your account and data at any time.

We store your data securely using Firebase and encrypted storage. Billing is handled by trusted providers like Stripe — we don’t see or store your card details.

## 4. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access or delete your data
- Update your preferences
- Cancel your subscription anytime
- Ask us questions about how your data is handled

You can do this in the app or by contacting us at support@bubbas.ai.

## 5. Ethics Policy

We built Bubbas.AI with intention. Here’s what we stand for:

- 🤝 User-first design — your well-being comes before features or profits.
- 🧠 Data minimalism — we only ask for what we truly need.
- 🔐 Privacy by design — everything personal is encrypted.
- 🚫 No manipulation — we never use dark patterns, misleading AI, or emotional pressure.
- 🌱 Transparency — we’ll always tell you how things work.

If we ever change how we handle things, we’ll let you know clearly.

## 6. Fair Use & Respect

You agree to:

- Use Bubbas.AI respectfully
- Not misuse or attempt to harm the system or other users
- Not use Bubbas.AI for illegal or harmful activities

We may suspend your access if needed to maintain a safe and ethical space.

## 7. Payments & Plans

Some features may require a subscription. Billing is processed securely via Stripe. You can cancel anytime. No surprise fees, ever.

## 8. Changes to This Document

We may occasionally update these terms. When we do, we’ll notify you in-app or by email if the changes are significant.
